# Project Goals 

This site is a base for my thesis research. My thesis is about pedagogy during the American 19th century Reconstruction Era and how we currently teach Reconstruction to  students. I'm also interested in policy formed during Reconstruction. The goals of this project are multi-layered and will build over time. The first goal is to complete a distant reading, then a close reading of Susan Eppes book *Through Some Eventful Years* (1926). I hope to collect data and use digital humanities (DH) tools, such as data visulization and topic modeling to complete this work.
