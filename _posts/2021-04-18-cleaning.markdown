## Part 1: 
1. I downloaded Eppes textbook on Hathitrust, both a pdf and text versions of the book. I used Microsoft Word to retrieve the word count of each chapter. I skimmed the each chapter of the text to see the years Eppes was referring to in each chapter and the location. I complied the metadata was I looking for (see data dictionary) in an Excel spreadsheet. 

## Part 2: 
2. I used Sublime Text for the majority of this project. When cleaning I used the find and replace option available through Sublime Text to find and replace the following: 
- Removed /n 
- Removed ## p. 
- Removed ## #s s s
- Removed #s s s 
- Removed --------------
- Removed odd characters 
- Removed extra line breaks, characters describing pictures/emblems
